by [Yating Huang](https://Yating-Huang.github.io/), Zhihui Lai, Wenjing Wang
## Summary:
### Intoduction:
  This repository is for our ICCPR2020 paper ["TU-Net: A Precise Network for Tongue Segmentation"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3436369.3437428)
  
  
### Framework:
![](https://github.com/Yating-Huang/TU-Net/blob/main/TU-Net.png)

## Usage:
### Requirement:
Ubuntu 16.04+pycharm+python3.6+pytorch1.7.1  
### Preprocessing:
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Yating-Huang/TU-Net.git
cd TU-Net
```
## How to run:
The only thing you should do is enter the dataset.py and correct the path of the datasets.
then run ~
example:
```
python main.py --action train&test --arch TUNet --epoch 2 --batch_size 2 
```
## Results
after train and test,3 folders will be created,they are "result","saved_model","saved_predict".

### saved_model folder:
After training,the saved model is in this folder.

### result folder:
in result folder,there are the logs and the line chart of metrics.such as:

### saved_predict folder:
in this folder,there are the ouput predict of the saved model,such as:
